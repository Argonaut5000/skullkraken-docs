# Breeding

## Breeding

Breeding is for SK + SK -> BB

### To breed you need 3 items:

* 2 Skullkrakens, these can be recognized by assets with "SKKR#" unitname.

* 1 Breeding Stone Token [Fertility|Shiny|Boost|Unique|Mutant|Dead]

### You can breed with a partner!

In this case each of you will need your own Skullkraken and your own Breeding Stone

### Submitting a breeding request

This can be done by using the `!$start_request` command in the bot channel in our discord. Note, that while submitting the request you be asked to choose a stone to use for the breeding. Be aware that this stone will be clawedback automatically from your wallet once the request is submitted.

### Other than the **Fertility Stone**, stones can be used to affect the resulting BB in may ways:
- **Shiny Stone:** Shiny stones guarantee a "Shiny" background for the BB and will therefore make the resulting BB labeled "Shiny". Shiny BBs have some advatanges for Splicing and Kindergarten.

- **Boost Stone:** Boost stones actually adds 4 pts to the base multiplier that is used in in calculating wiether a BB has a Shiny BG, Unique Feature, and odds of being Mutant or Dead.

- **Unique Stone:** Unique stones guarantee the resulting BB will be given unique item or feature that will not be used again by any other BB.

- **Mutant and Dead Stones:** These stones will guarantee that "status" of the BB.

### Skullkraken Parent's Natural Boost Modifiers

Some SKs have bonus "boost modifiers" based on:

* Being labeled OG or OGC = +1 pts (per og/ogc parent)

* Shiny or Collab pieces = Extra possibility +3 pts (per shiny/collab parent)

* Skullkraken #0001 - #0025 = Extra possibility +3 (per numbered parent)

* Skullkraken #0026 - #0050 = Extra possibility +2 (per numbered parent)

* Skullkraken #0051 - #0099 = Extra possibility +1 (per numbered parent)

### Shiny and Collab Parents Benifits
Shiny and Collab parents have 25% probability to make a BB Shiny.

## Splicing 

Splicing is for BB + BB = Rewards [Stones|Ticket]

### To splice you need 3 items:

* 2 BBs, these can be recognized by assets with "BBSK#" unitname.

* 1 Splicing Token

Splicing actually uses the same logic as breeding. It goes through all the steps the same way, literally calculating a baby but with the addition of the last step, which takes the calculated baby and parents, then take the highest rarity of the three.

Once that rarity is chosen we use it to roll for reward

**Shiny:** The owner gets an extra roll for a reward and gets to keep the best roll.

Based on the rarity calculated above these are the odds for each rarity:

- **Basic**

    * Fertility - 50%

    * Boost - 25%

    * Unique or Shiny - 8%

    * Ticket - 5%

    * Death or Mutant Stone - 2%

- **Rare**
    
    * Fertility - 40%

    * Boost - 30%

    * Unique or Shiny - 9%

    * Ticket - 6%

    * Death or Mutant Stone - 3%

- **Epic**
    
    * Fertility - 30%
    
    * Boost - 35%
    
    * Unique or Shiny - 10%
    
    * Ticket - 7%
    
    * Dead or Mutant - 4%

- **Legendary**
    
    * Fertility - 15%

    * Boost - 40%

    * Unique or Shiny - 12%
    
    * Ticket - 9%

    * Dead or Mutant - 6%

- **Dead Or Mutant**
    
    * Fertility - 10%
